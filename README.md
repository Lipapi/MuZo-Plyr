The page has a title "MuZo Plyr". The page also sets the viewport to adjust the width of the page to the width of the device.

In the body of the page, there is a header that includes the title "MuZo Plyr" and a set of controls for playing music, including buttons for previous, play, pause, next, and repeat. The header also includes two paragraphs for displaying a quote and date.

The main content of the page is a container for the music player, which includes a dropdown menu for selecting songs, an image for displaying the album cover, and an audio element for playing the selected song.

The page includes a JavaScript script that handles the functionality of the music player, such as loading the selected song, playing and pausing the audio, and moving to the previous and next songs. The script also toggles the repeat button.
